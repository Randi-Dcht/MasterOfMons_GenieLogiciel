An agreement has been signed to perpetuate the Hibakusha Park in this function, between the University of Mons (UMONS), the Center of Applied Ecology of Hainaut (CEAH), the Association of Doctors for the Prevention of Nuclear War (AMPGN ), the NATO Monitoring Committee (CSO) and the National Coordination of Action for Peace and Democracy (CNAPD), of which Pr.

GDPMons=It is also in this arena that the legendary fight between Saint George and the Dragon takes place every Sunday of the Trinity. Of course, the town hall holds the attention of all lovers of architecture. This Gothic pearl surmounted by a baroque bell-tower is the work of Mathieu de Layens, also author of the town hall of Louvain. Unfinished, it has only one floor. Yet its build surprises. As it stands, it dominates all the other neighboring constructions. And then there is this little monkey on the facade who loves having his head caressed! Is it the work of a blacksmith, a tavern sign? Very clever one who can claim to know where he comes from. A caress of the left hand on the head would deliver a year of happiness. It's worth a try
